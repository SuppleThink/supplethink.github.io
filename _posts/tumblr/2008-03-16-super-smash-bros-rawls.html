When a beloved game franchise goes in new places in ways that change its fundaments, the results can be disappointing.  One needn&#8217;t look beyond the recent Burnout Paradise to see this writ large, but it&#8217;s been happening increasingly often of late as the old giants of the industry start to feel the need for the ol&#8217; Harrison Ford earring.<br/></div><div> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">One thing that makes this version of Smash Brothers so jarring is the steeper learning curve.  Traditionally an approachable party game, Smash Brothers: Rawls challenges players more on every level.  Most people will probably be able to get through the game right away, but to really <em>get</em> it takes an understanding of the principles of justice set forth by Aristotle, Rousseau, Mill, and even a little Nozick in the later levels.  Nintendo helpfully included unlockable excerpts from these thinkers to aid new players, but the effectiveness of 60 seconds of <em>Anarchy, the State, and Utopia</em> is hard to measure.  Additionally, the perplexing and somewhat offensive decision to make the Sandel excerpts Japan-only makes the package somewhat less appealing to American players.<br/></div><div> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While I found the new character select screen innovative and fun (players now select a character without knowing which one they will control once the game starts), I was less impressed with the new &#8220;Veil of Ignorance&#8221; power up.  HAL Laboratories was obviously trying to encourage verbal interaction and shouting matches between players, but having it just turn three quarters of the screen black seems like a lazy implementation of an idea with great potential.  Having it occult the damage/lives indicator would have made more sense, especially considering the overall brokenness of the new &#8220;fairness meter&#8221;.<br/><br/>All that said, SSB:R is a splendid fighting game, well balanced and thoroughly considered.  Every time I lost a match or died in the single-player mode I knew it was just, and the controls are responsive and intuitive.<br/><br/>This game is recommended for anyone who likes the point to be made early on and then repeated for 300 pages.<br/></div>
