That is the person who owns an XBox and only 1 game and only plays one game exclusively.  The game being Halo 2.  I can&#8217;t claim to hate these individuals anymore as I really REALLY enjoyed my time as one of them.  (Also it would be absolutely ridiculous to actually hate someone for this reason.)  I was playing an average of 12 hours a night, while working full time and also going to a couple concerts a week.  This was barely possible and only possible with the help of Rock Star Energy drink.  Of course at the end of a Halo 2 stint I would be left with a 3 week long cold/sickness due to barely sleeping and having a weakened immune system.  My problem was so serious an intervention had to be formed.  <p>I made a special trip to the store last night to pick up some Halo 3 Mountain Dew Game Fuel.  With 30% more caffeine!  I was so happy to see Master Chief and the Halo 3 logo there on the Mountain Dew packaging in front of me.  Yesterday was it&#8217;s release day, since when does Soda have a release day?  What possessed me to go to the store and purchase this and drink it?!?!  I drink an average of less than a soda a week so this is unlike me.  Also I generally hate Burger King&#8217;s food, I heard that they are going to have some exclusive Halo 3 xbox live codes for content.  I hate to say it but if this is true it will convince me to choke down some of their food.  So please don&#8217;t let this be true!  After all I did when Sneak King came out.  Also the Halo themed packaging seems to only be on the &#8220;King&#8221; sized meal cup and fries.  King sized whatever that is,it involves a 42 ounce soda apparently, sounds absolutely disgusting.     </p> <p>I played a few times in the Halo 3 beta when it was open through Crackdown.  The first time I saw all the stats tracking which made Halo 2 so addictive for me, I thought maybe I should quit this game right now.  I foresee many great long and wonderful nights of Halo 3 parties in the near future though.  With 4 player online co-op I know I&#8217;m going to be spending a lot of time on this one.  It has yet to be seen if my game addiction will play out with this version like it did the last, I&#8217;m not very good anymore since I&#8217;ve been rehabbed.  But does that make it less fun?  There are too many other games on the horizon and I have to enjoy them all.  In the 6 weeks before Halo 3 is released I will be acquiring and playing Bioshock, Blue Dragon, and Eternal Sonata.  How is this ever going to work?  I have no idea&#8230;does it make having a game addiction ok if I play different games or  just spend all my free time on one particular one.  Not sure if I even have any free time&#8230;    </p>
