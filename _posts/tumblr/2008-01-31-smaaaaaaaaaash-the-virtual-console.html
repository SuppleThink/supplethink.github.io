A thread on <a href="http://www.gamespite.net/talkingtime/showthread.php?t=3091">Gamespite</a> indicated that <em>Earthbound</em> was one of the demos. This is reflected on the Japanese Smash Bros. <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/jp/gamemode/various/various23.html">site</a>, but if you visit the equivilant english <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various23.html">page</a> <em>Earthbound</em> is missing. Good job denying the fans a niche title and the possibility of easy money from releasing the game as a tie-in with Smash Bros.</div><br/><div>I&#8217;ve become so disallusioned with Nintendo&#8217;s Virtual Console service that I&#8217;ve been digging around for other classic game collections on recient consoles. I highly reccomend the <em>Taito Legends Collections </em>on PS2 they <a href="http://www.taitolegends2.com/">contain</a> an absurd amount of excellent gameplay from all genres for low price. How can you say no to classic arcade SHMUPS, action games and puzzlers with perfect emulation for 15-20 bucks? </div>
