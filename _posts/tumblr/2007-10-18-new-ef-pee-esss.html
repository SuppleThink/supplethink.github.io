It’s absolutely without peer, it blends together everything that is good and right into what is the video game equivalent of an orgasm. </div><div><br/></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Portal blends FPS aesthetics, unique puzzles and NEW game play concepts with a sense of humor that is as black as a python funeral. Christ, just <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&amp;SubId=469">buy it already</a>! </div><div><br/>The game also caters to speed runners, as each puzzle can be solved in several &#8220;incorrect&#8221; ways. Youtube is already rife with videos of people completing puzzles in confusing and stomach churning ways (watching &amp; playing this game can cause motion sickness). The game has built in optional features designed for ‘running, a clock to keep track of how fast you are and a “portal” counter to keep track of how many portals you’ve used (for “minimum complete” ‘runners”). Why aren’t you playing this right <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&amp;SubId=469">now</a>!</div><div><br/>What the internet thinks of Portal*: </div><ul><li>"I would set up a portal to Taco Bell inside my living room so when I get drunk I can just stumble in, get a chalupa, and leave"<br/></li><li>"one portal at hone one at gamestop so i could play the motorstorm demo all night when they closed"<br/></li><li>"ohm y fucking god i just came everyuwhere"<br/></li><li>"i would put one end in front of my fist and the other in front of nintendo so I COULD PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE FOR DELAYING MY SMASH BROSEH" </li></ul><div>You need this game.
