<p>Most gamers inadvertently collect lots of peripheral devices that are used with just a few games. The best examples of this are DDR pads, Pop&#8217;n controllers, Guncons &amp; Beatmania keyboards. Another class of peripherals are data transfer devices like the PocketStation, GBA-&gt;GC cable, e-Reader and the Playstation Eye. It&#8217;s always vexing when the consumer buys a peripheral believing that it&#8217;ll be well supported and then it is quickly forgotten and only used for one or a handful of games. It&#8217;s easy to look upon a collection of console peripherals and see nothing but a pile of broken promises.<br/><br/>However, one must also mention the all-rounder of console peripherals, the arcade stick, unlike the previously mentioned devices they are almost never game specific and can be used for fighting games, SHMUPs and classic games like <em>Pac-Man</em>, <em>Robotron 2084</em>.<br/><br/>The topic of non-specific controllers &amp; peripherals brings me to my most fondly remembered console accessory, the Sony Dual Analog.<br/><br/><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKosKWgJ6eI/AAAAAAAAAK8/7EBESeAqFY4/s1600-h/da_01.JPG"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5236046073122384354" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKosKWgJ6eI/AAAAAAAAAK8/7EBESeAqFY4/s320/da_01.JPG" border="0"/></a></p><center><em>Check out that beige carpet.</em></center><br/><br/>The Dual Analog predates the Dual Shock in the American retail channel by roughly a year, and other than it&#8217;s lack of rumble it is noticeably larger than any other 1st Party Playstation gamepad. I personally find it to be the most comfortable Playstation gamepad ever produced, the rubber nub-less concave analog sticks and beefy grips are extremely comfortable for marathon gaming sessions. I bought mine in 1997 because of early analog support Playstation games like <em>Colony Wars </em>and <em>Bushido Blade</em>.<br/><br/><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKoyHyie7QI/AAAAAAAAALM/lhnw_4Xh0Ik/s1600-h/da_03.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5236052626178501890" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKoyHyie7QI/AAAAAAAAALM/lhnw_4Xh0Ik/s320/da_03.jpg" border="0"/></a><center><em>Grips so substantial even a ham beast would find it comfortable</em></center><br/><br/>When the Dual Shock was released in 1998 I was very disappointed that it was not the same size as the Dual Analog, so I continued to use my Dual Analog well into the PS2 era. I finally retired the Dual Analog in late 2001, figuring that the Dual Shock 2 was better suited for most PS2 titles.<br/><br/>While the Dual Analog is a fairly rare Playstation accessory today, it isn&#8217;t worth that much even with the original box. I think one of the reasons that such an excellent controller isn&#8217;t more fondly remembered or desired is because the Dual Analog was only useful for a handful of games before it was supplanted by the Dual Shock and a flood of analog+rumble supported games.<br/><br/><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKozK7epamI/AAAAAAAAALk/2gMKFQ56Tas/s1600-h/da_04.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5236053779629566562" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKozK7epamI/AAAAAAAAALk/2gMKFQ56Tas/s320/da_04.jpg" border="0"/></a><center><em>Unlike the initial American Xbox controller, the Dual Analog is light and comfortable.</em></center><br/><br/>Oh well, I still enjoy using mine ever once in a while. The controller&#8217;s &#8220;beefiness&#8221; just seems right when I&#8217;m playing <em>Godhand</em>.<br/><br/>Do you fondly remember a specific peripheral? Let us know in the comments.<blockquote></blockquote>
