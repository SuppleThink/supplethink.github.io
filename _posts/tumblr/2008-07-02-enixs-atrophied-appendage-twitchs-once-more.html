I guess this is the sign we&#8217;ve been waiting for.<br/><br/>Back when Enix and Square merged many invisioned a future where both RPG power-houses would colaborate and create a slave army of basement dwelling teenagers that would be wholely incapable of doing anything more menacing than making people around them feel uncomfortable any time they open their maws to emit a horrible mixture of internet memes and feminine Japanese. <br/><br/>While the above nightmare has come to pass, it is not by Enix&#8217;s hand. They actually merged with Square to endlessly rehash all of Square&#8217;s old properties until they are completely unprofitable. While Enix&#8217;s wish to grind Square into dust may seem cruel, at least they have found a way to keep Tetsuya Nomura&#8217;s emaciated, zipper clad, emo charecter designs from infecting other games. <br/><br/>With <em>Chrono Trigger</em> on the horizon I suppose a wireless multiplayer version of <em>Secret of Mana</em> isn&#8217;t far behind.<br/><br/>The only reasons I would consider replaying <em>Chrono Trigger</em> again is to name everyone in my party Lavos.</p>
