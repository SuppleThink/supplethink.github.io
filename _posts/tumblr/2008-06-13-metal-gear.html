I must admit I bought the game on a lark, using a gift card that had been languishing for 3+ months in my gift card pile. However, it&#8217;s turned out to be the best RPG I&#8217;ve played in a decade.<br/><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SFIjtwRz6wI/AAAAAAAAAJU/y6RrBM57fG8/s1600-h/mainart_fullsize.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SFIjtwRz6wI/AAAAAAAAAJU/y6RrBM57fG8/s320/mainart_fullsize.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5211266987781778178"/></a><br/>Yes, this is the best RPG I&#8217;ve played since <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. Having never played a Persona game before, I find the battle system and dynamic rogue-like dungeons entertaining and surprisingly grind free. The non-dungeon portion of the game plays like a dating game without being lame. However I must admit that I would be embarrassed to play this game in front of other people while walking around the in-game high school flirting with animu women.<br/><br/>The game&#8217;s art direction and music are excellent, the art direction in <em>Persona 3</em> is distinct and in-game environments are vibrant; the game&#8217;s menus themselves are quite a sight to behold, I spent 15 minutes in the menus during the first 90 minutes of the game simply using them to watch them unfold and explode with color and art. The music is a Japanese ambient hip-hop blend that never overpowers the player, accentuating the action in dungeons and adding a sorely needed rhythm to the school life sections of the game.<br/><br/>While I am obviously gushing and have not completed the game yet, I do feel that Persona 3 is worth a look if you&#8217;ve got the time. I suppose my temporary lack of PS3 is a blessing in disguise, it&#8217;s allowed me to give my undivided attention to a game that had previously been assigned to my disturbingly large &#8220;unplayed games&#8221; pile.</p>
