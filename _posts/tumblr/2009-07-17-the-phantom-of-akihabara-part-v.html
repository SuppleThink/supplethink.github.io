<p>&#8220;<em>“The game industry is a master-and-slave system,” the owner said. “It’s endemic. The console makers kowtow to the government with regulations stricter than what the government would’ve forced on ‘em. The game makers kowtow to them because the distribution system gives them no other choice. And the buyers aren’t helpin’, either. Nobody ever got sued for releasing bad or buggy games. They just want the special-edition bonuses. One thing’s for sure — you ain’t gonna find a industry that’s more manipulable than this.”</em>&#8221;<br/><br/><a href="http://magweasel.com/2009/07/16/phantom-of-akihabara-5/">The Phantom of Akihabara - Part V</a></p>
