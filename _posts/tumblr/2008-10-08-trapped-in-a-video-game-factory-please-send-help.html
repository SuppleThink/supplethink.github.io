<p>I have a problem, and it is a mental one. No, a different one. This is the one where I suddenly decide, &#8220;Hey, I like computer games and talking about them, why don&#8217;t I make one?&#8221; I just had another attack recently.<br/><br/>I have chosen to take on this latest relapse of mental colic in a different way. Instead of outlining an exhaustive design document this time around, I&#8217;ve chosen to start implementing what strikes my fancy at the time. This of course, has lead to a Montana Free Militia-worthy arsenal of guns, grenades, laser drones, and little bobbing things that spray bullets everywhere. I have yet to decide what this says about my state of mind.<br/><br/>When I started tooling around with it, I loved Game Maker. Between the drag-and-drop and scripting aspects of the programming, it was basically instant gratification. I could get a game up and running without having to fiddle with bedrock stuff like sprite management, collision detection, update cycles, instance tracking, etc. All that was taken care of by Game Maker. I could just get down to the business of designing.<br/><br/>But then the cracks started appearing. I began to realize that while I didn&#8217;t have to worry about the basic machinery, it also meant that I didn&#8217;t have a say in how things were done. It was like the death of a thousand cuts. Oh, the color of the bottom-left pixel always determines the transparency color for sprites? I need to make an entirely new object to create multiple hit-boxes? I have to do WHAT to get a 2D traceline working?<br/><br/>I was getting antsy to say the least. So I started messing around with the XNA framework. I found the additional muscle and flexibility liberating, but starting with Game Maker did have some benefits. Mainly that the additional flexibility that I found with XNA would have paralyzed me with indecision. Without the basic understanding of game program flow that I gained from using Game Maker, I would not have known where to start. So ultimately, starting with Game Maker isn&#8217;t a bad idea at all. Just don&#8217;t be upset when you start hitting Game Maker&#8217;s limitations. All that means is that you&#8217;re ready to move on, so why not do so?<br/><br/>Seeing things like the XNA framework, Popcap&#8217;s Sexy framework, the improvements in PyGame and more recenly WiiWare, are very heartening to me. Making games is a process that has become ludicrously more laborious and costly as time goes on. That there are measures being taken to mitigate this for the little guy can only be a good thing. I say this with the full knowledge that we&#8217;ll have to endure a tsunami of garbage before getting the good stuff. But we&#8217;re all jaded enough here that I think this goes without saying.<br/><br/>Basically this has just been a rambling post on my shallow forays into game making and you probably shouldn&#8217;t take too much stock in it (if anyone is even reading this fucking thing in the first place, that is). For all my talk about XNA, I&#8217;m probably going to stick with Game Maker for a little while longer, mainly because I&#8217;m so lazy. That, and I have yet to be even in the same ZIP code occupied by people who are serious about making games. My vain hope is that one day I&#8217;ll get out of my &#8220;Me too!&#8221; amateur rut and produce something serviceable.<br/><br/>A guy can dream, right?</p>
