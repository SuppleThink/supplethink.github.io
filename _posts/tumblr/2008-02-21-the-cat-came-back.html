I recently found out about Hello Kitty Online from the website <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/">kotaku.com</a>.  Now I&#8217;m not the type to play a mass multiplayer online game.  I like my games to end and I like playing a lot of different games instead of just one game.  After seeing the screenshots though and reading the description I immediately signed up for the closed beta!!!  Apparently 40,000+ people have signed up so I hope I make it in. Is this what we call taking one for the team? Also the game will be free, here is the website complete with happy music&#8230;<a href="http://www.hellokittyonline.com/us/">http://www.hellokittyonline.com/us/</a><br/><br/><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_RlH7yYZ8LZo/R707XiOeASI/AAAAAAAAABk/kLqLWAmDQks/s1600-h/hello-kitty-transformer-sewing-machine.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_RlH7yYZ8LZo/R707XiOeASI/AAAAAAAAABk/kLqLWAmDQks/s320/hello-kitty-transformer-sewing-machine.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5169353222801719586" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Here is an excerpt from a conversation I had with J. Durfy regarding this:<br/><span style="font-size:100%;"> <p style="font-family: times new roman;">J. Durfy:  I thought you were over hello kitty, is it like some sort of addiction where you can fall back into your old ways?</p><p style="font-family: times new roman;">Me:  Hrrm, the game looks awesome though.  Just tired of getting the merchandise 50 million times a year. </p><p style="font-family: times new roman;"> I already have like 6 notepads that are shaped like her head.</p></span><span style="font-size:85%;"> </span>
