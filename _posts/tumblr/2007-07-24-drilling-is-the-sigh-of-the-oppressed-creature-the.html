The driller becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. With the increasing value of the world of things proceeds in direct proportion to the devaluation of the world of men. Drilling produces not only commodities; it produces itself and the driller as a commodity &#8212; and does so in the proportion in which it produces commodities generally." - Marx, Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts (1844)<br/><br/><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TiCPAlyQadQ/RqsP-bPu1iI/AAAAAAAAANU/xiVDhSqe984/s1600-h/1295.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TiCPAlyQadQ/RqsP-bPu1iI/AAAAAAAAANU/xiVDhSqe984/s320/1295.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5092181368812525090" border="0"/></a>"The exchange value of a commodity estimated in blocks is called its price.

It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural superiors”, and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous “air”. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom — Arcade Mode. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation."</p>
