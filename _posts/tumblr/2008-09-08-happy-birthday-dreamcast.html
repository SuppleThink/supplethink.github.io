The Dreamcast came out on 09/09/1999 and barely lasted 2 years in the retail channel.<br/><br/>If you somehow missed the train on the Dreamcast and want to find out what all the hubub is about you can buy one for the same price as a pair of flip-flops. No need to worry about throwing your money down a sink-hole by buying rare games for a dead system because the Dreamcast was cracked so hard you can just burn CDroms and they play. <br/><br/>This week&#8217;s ultra-long <a href="http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3?http://download.gamevideos.com/Podcasts/Retronauts/R090408.mp3">Retronauts</a> does a good job recapping the short (and some would say depressing) history of the Dreamcast.<br/><br/>Here are two reasons why the Dreamcast was awesome:<br/><br/><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/IaRWBBIPFfA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/IaRWBBIPFfA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br/><em>Sega was humble. </em><br/>Or maybe just desperate. Does groveling actually work in a TV ad?<br/><br/><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ga62uiXbEjI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ga62uiXbEjI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br/><em>Jesus Christ, that cat just ate all those mice!</em><br/>This is the best video game commercial ever.
