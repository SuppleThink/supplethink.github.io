A few weeks ago, my friends and I filmed a test episode for an American version of GameCenter CX.<br/><br/>While it&#8217;s still in being edited (I believe we shot over 14 hours of footage), I do have some photos that were taken during filming to share.<br/><br/><br/><p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKCi7mPXPyI/AAAAAAAAAKU/yMKnhKCD7qs/s1600-h/IMG_0072.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5233361911765483298" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKCi7mPXPyI/AAAAAAAAAKU/yMKnhKCD7qs/s320/IMG_0072.jpg" border="0"/></a>Our brave Hero, Tweak. He&#8217;ll be the host/victim of Gamecenter US. You can almost see the gears turning inside his head as he attempts to solve one of the game&#8217;s many illogical puzzles.</p><p><br/></p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKCjjhbsMYI/AAAAAAAAAKc/hK-JpACSLzA/s1600-h/IMG_0041.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5233362597669777794" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKCjjhbsMYI/AAAAAAAAAKc/hK-JpACSLzA/s320/IMG_0041.jpg" border="0"/></a> While it could be considered cruel to lock Tweak in a room for as long as it takes to beat a game we (the producers) were not completely without compassion. Snacks that Tweak requested were provided.<br/><br/><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKCkZ8xf7gI/AAAAAAAAAKk/Ksb_ygiZqGo/s1600-h/IMG_0073.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5233363532721942018" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKCkZ8xf7gI/AAAAAAAAAKk/Ksb_ygiZqGo/s320/IMG_0073.jpg" border="0"/></a> This is the ideal set design for our show, a snack table, original game w/ package and a very uncomfortable chair without optimum viewing height for the CRT TV to exacerbate any frustration Tweak may experience while challenging the game.<br/><br/><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKClPAl8_yI/AAAAAAAAAKs/ibZCCuqOpa0/s1600-h/IMG_0058.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5233364444280323874" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKClPAl8_yI/AAAAAAAAAKs/ibZCCuqOpa0/s320/IMG_0058.jpg" border="0"/></a> After 6+ hours of filming I was quite tired, but unlike Tweak I had a comfortable chair to relax in when not working.<br/><br/><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKCmDrM1BjI/AAAAAAAAAK0/ifRSZ90xtHQ/s1600-h/IMG_0083_2.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5233365349070865970" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SKCmDrM1BjI/AAAAAAAAAK0/ifRSZ90xtHQ/s320/IMG_0083_2.jpg" border="0"/></a> Victory at last, but at what cost?
