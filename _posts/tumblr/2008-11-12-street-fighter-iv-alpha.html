The home version of Street Fighter IV keeps getting better and better. Capcom recently <a href="http://www.capcom-unity.com/shotokantuning/blog/2008/11/11/street_fighter_iv_chapter_25_rose_the_mystic_woman_soul_power_master_alpha_team_hits_again">announced</a> that Rose would be in the home version. While I&#8217;m happy that we&#8217;re getting such a eclectic mixture of characters in the new game I hope that some Street Fighter III characters make the cut, Q and Makoto need to be in this game.<br/><br/><embed id="VideoPlayback" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid=3588854476570186256&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=true" style="width:400px;height:326px" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed>
