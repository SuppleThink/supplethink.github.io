<em>Street Fighter IV</em> is going to land in our sticky little hands eventually and Capcom hopes that people who don&#8217;t worshop at the alter of Street Fighter will buy it. Capcom&#8217;s promotion of the title with slick screen caps and exclusive previews in the likes of EGM appease the core audience and make the game seem quite attractive to non-expert players.<br/><br/>I recently read that the game was not being developed internally at Capcom as I&#8217;d been lead to believe and that it had been farmed out to <a href="http://www.dimps.co.jp/">Dimps</a>, the shovelware and anime game company made up of ex-SNK employees who&#8217;ve brought us such memorable titles as <em>Inuyasha: A feudal Fairy Tale</em>, <em>Digimon Battle Spirit 2</em> and the failed Atomiswave/PS2 vs. Fighter <em>The Rumble Fish</em>. <br/><br/>Great.<br/><br/>While I will reserve judgment until I&#8217;ve had some hands-on time I must admit that I am no longer anticipating <em>Street Fighter IV</em>. The game still has potential to be great, but I am curious as to why Capcom would farm out such an important nostalgic title to Dimps. Maybe it doesn&#8217;t make financial sense to put your good staff on a niche genre title like Street Fighter.<br/><br/><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/p3oi0ZacgoI&amp;hl=en"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/p3oi0ZacgoI&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>
