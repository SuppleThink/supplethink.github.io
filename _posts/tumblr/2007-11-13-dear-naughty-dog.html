<p>I sent the following to Naughty Dog after playing a demo of their first Non-Furry video game, <em>Uncharted: Drake&#8217;s Fortune</em>.<br/><br/><span style="font-family:courier new;">I just finished playing the “Uncharted: Drakes Fortune” demo on my PS3, and I’d like to give you some feedback.<br/><br/>I love the art direction, music and tongue-in-cheek voice acting. The game has the look and feel of a Indiana Jones film or Phantom comic without pandering to the fans of these works too much. The control and player animation are wonderful, I was surprised that I could use the L3 button to change which hand I held my firearm in!<br/><br/>I have one major complaint, the firearm control is very poor. There is no auto aim and I felt that it really took me out of the experience. I understand that the combat is structured around using cover and taking aimed shots, but I found aiming so tedious that I will not be buying this game. I am not interested in running from point to point trying to maneuver a tiny set of crosshairs over a target 10 pixels on a side that blends into the surrounding environment.. I had to strain my eyes to see my targets even with a 36 inch HDtv w/ HDMI.<br/><br/>However, I’d be sure to give this game another look if at some point you released a patch that added auto-aiming.<br/><br/>Good luck with your future games,<br/><br/>J. Durfy</span><br/><span style="font-family:Courier New;"></span><br/>This is the first time I&#8217;ve been compelled to send a developer any feedback about their game. I suppose it&#8217;s because I feel that a little push could make the game playable and very enjoyable.<br/><span style="font-family:arial;"></span><br/><span style="font-family:Arial;">It&#8217;s always painful when something you&#8217;ve been looking forward to turns out badly. While this 3d platforming experience may have turned out poorly, S<strong>u</strong>pe<strong>r</strong> <strong>M</strong>a<strong>r</strong>io <strong>Ga</strong>lax<strong>y</strong> tomorrow will surely deliver all the platforming fun I&#8217;ve been craving since Shadow of the Colossus ended.</span><span style="font-family:courier new;"><br/></span><span style="font-family:courier new;"></span></p>
