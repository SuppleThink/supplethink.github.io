I do want to avoid crap like &#8220;Top 100 games with hats in them and if you disagree then screw you&#8221; though, so I just want to express that this list is, like, my opinion man, so just chill if you think I am in the wrong.<br/><br/><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Five Developers I want to give money to </span></span><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">(but I can&#8217;t, within reason):</span></span><br/><br/><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TiCPAlyQadQ/R8djTwSzqUI/AAAAAAAABDg/44Tak9g8-8I/s1600-h/earthbound+art.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TiCPAlyQadQ/R8djTwSzqUI/AAAAAAAABDg/44Tak9g8-8I/s200/earthbound+art.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5172211888090753346" border="0"/></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">#5 -  </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigesato_Itoi" title="Shigesato Itoi">Shigesato Itoi</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">  (Earthbound / Mother series):</span><br/>This one is the biggest stretch since technically I can import Japanese versions of Mother 3 and Mother 1+2, but his games are ones I want to play in English to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of them. Unfortunately, Nintendo seems to have a secret agenda to keep the Mother series from ever returning to the states. They have even gone so far as to remove the Earthbound Virtual Console demo from the U.S. version of Smash Bros. Brawl (or so I hear).  At least Ness is still in Smah Bros., so they can&#8217;t deny the existence of Mother completely. Sad.<br/><br/><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TiCPAlyQadQ/R8djggSzqVI/AAAAAAAABDo/jMKfeQoVJ2Q/s1600-h/okami.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TiCPAlyQadQ/R8djggSzqVI/AAAAAAAABDo/jMKfeQoVJ2Q/s200/okami.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5172212107134085458" border="0"/></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">#4 - </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clover_Studio" title="Clover Studio">Clover Studio</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"> (Okami, God Hand, Viewtiful Joe):</span><br/>While it&#8217;s true that the talent and management behind Clover Studio are still around and making games inside and out of Capcom, what&#8217;s nice about buying games from a particular studio is how you can vote with your gaming dollar on what developers you want to see games from again. The biggest slap in the face with this one is how Okami is getting ported to the Wii, but in buying it none of the money or credit is really going to Clover Studio proper. Again, cry.<br/><br/><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TiCPAlyQadQ/R8djtASzqWI/AAAAAAAABDw/YKvF6U6dTcY/s1600-h/screen1.gif"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TiCPAlyQadQ/R8djtASzqWI/AAAAAAAABDw/YKvF6U6dTcY/s200/screen1.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5172212321882450274" border="0"/></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">#3 - </span><span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:Verdana;font-size:85%;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ben Croshaw / Yahtzee ( </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/5days/">5 Days a Stranger</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/7days/">7 Days a Skeptic</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/1213/">1213</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">):</span><br/>Why yes, I am referring to that Yahtzee, the one that talks really fast about games and it&#8217;s funny. As it turns out, he can make a mean game as well as he can bitch about them. Ben&#8217;s adventure games are some of the most well-written adventure games I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of playing. So much in fact, that I feel he deserves money for a game that he offers for free. If his games were offered on say Steam or Xbox Live Arcade I would pony up the cash for &#8216;em on the spot. Better yet, if I could get a hard copy on disc that would be quite nice.<br/>(Note: As I was typing this and linking to his games, I noticed that he has a donation page set up for each game, and if you donate 5 bucks you get a special edition version. I think I might just take him up on that.)<br/><br/><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TiCPAlyQadQ/R8dktgSzqXI/AAAAAAAABD4/Qmg_YONmjo8/s1600-h/freespace06_v2-10095.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TiCPAlyQadQ/R8dktgSzqXI/AAAAAAAABD4/Qmg_YONmjo8/s200/freespace06_v2-10095.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5172213429984012658" border="0"/></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">#2&#160;</span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.facepunchstudios.com/">- Garry Newman / Facepunch Studios </a><span style="font-weight: bold;">(Garry&#8217;s Mod, Facewound):</span><br/>Now before someone gets fresh and says something like &#8220;well just buy Garry&#8217;s Mod off of Steam, you mingebag,&#8221; I just want to point out that I HAVE purchased Garry&#8217;s Mod, and in fact I even paid for Gold Membership at the gmod forums to get early access to beta versions of Garry&#8217;s Mod. I&#8217;m that hardcore, alright? It&#8217;s just that I want to give him more money. I *heart* Garry.<br/><br/><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TiCPAlyQadQ/R8dk-gSzqYI/AAAAAAAABEA/dBubZffpf0o/s1600-h/katamaricavestory.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TiCPAlyQadQ/R8dk-gSzqYI/AAAAAAAABEA/dBubZffpf0o/s200/katamaricavestory.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5172213722041788802" border="0"/></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">#1 - <a href="http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA022293/">Daisuke Amaya / Pixel</a> (<a href="http://www.miraigamer.net/cavestory/">Doukutsu Monogatari / Cave Story</a>)</span><br/>Man, this guy. How is it one of the best games I&#8217;ve played in the past couple years is a freeware game made by one person? This guy deserves my money so much it&#8217;s a crime. I want to pay to own a copy of this game. I want to own it on multiple consoles, including at least one handheld. I want to buy all kinds of crazy Cave Story merchandise, like t-shirts, plushes, and action figures. I want there to be a sequel, I would wait in line until midnight to buy it.<br/><br/><br/>But I can&#8217;t.</p>
