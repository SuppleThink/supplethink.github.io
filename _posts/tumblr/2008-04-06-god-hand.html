<div style="text-align: justify;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iYhX8dUeagI/R_lfb8g5JsI/AAAAAAAAAHI/Y8VNgAyXIDY/s1600-h/clover.jpeg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iYhX8dUeagI/R_lfb8g5JsI/AAAAAAAAAHI/Y8VNgAyXIDY/s200/clover.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5186281379599034050" border="0"/></a>So it turns out that the lead guys from Clover Studios <a href="http://www.platinumgames.co.jp/en_about/message.html">are still out there</a>, and with the Wii port of <span style="font-style: italic;">Okami</span> anyone who hasn&#8217;t felt the love yet should get started.  The game rains down style on you for like forty hours, and shows Nintendo that if they&#8217;re not going to take <span style="font-style: italic;">Zelda</span> anywhere then other people are certainly up for the job.  Once you&#8217;re done getting a furry handjob from <span style="font-style: italic;">Okami</span>, though, I&#8217;ve got something you need to try:<br/></div><br/><br/><br/><div> </div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_iYhX8dUeagI/R_lcGsg5JrI/AAAAAAAAAHA/Sq8YGhKSIOo/s1600-h/GOD_HAND.jpeg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_iYhX8dUeagI/R_lcGsg5JrI/AAAAAAAAAHA/Sq8YGhKSIOo/s400/GOD_HAND.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5186277715991930546" border="0"/></a><br/><div style="text-align: justify;">Where Okami makes love to you, <strong>GOD HAND</strong> rapes you into tiny pieces without even noticing you&#8217;re there.  Remember when games weren&#8217;t just hard?  Remember when you needed not just the skills but the right <em>constitution</em> to finish a beat-&#8216;em-up?  Besting <strong>GOD HAND</strong> is a triumph of <em>will</em>, a demonstration of one&#8217;s ability to go beyond playing the game and take up the reins of one&#8217;s own destiny.  To complete <strong>GOD HAND</strong> is to face one&#8217;s ownmost, inevitable, yet indefinite potentiality-of-being.  As <em>born</em>, the player undertakes the journey.  <em>Dying</em>, the player discovers the resoluteness to complete it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div> </div><br/><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">GOD HAND</span> gets a lot of gruff for being &#8220;too hard&#8221;.  I&#8217;m here to tell you that that is an ignorant thing to say.  Despite its difficulty, <span style="font-weight: bold;">GOD HAND</span> is one of the most fair games I&#8217;ve ever played, and while it is extremely difficult, it has a scaling difficulty system that lets you and the game reach a natural equilibrium while still rewarding skillful play.  There are two different kinds of super-powerful attacks that you can use strategically, and every time you die in the game you not only learn a ton from your mistakes, but also get to keep any moves and cash you picked up.  This is an example of one of <span style="font-weight: bold;">GOD HAND</span>'s most brilliant accomplishments: the complete abandonment of archaic and irritating game behavior.<br/></div><br/><div style="text-align: justify;">Every single power-up item an enemy drops or you find in a crate will stay on the level indefinitely.  This means you don&#8217;t have to waste a healing item when you don&#8217;t need it, you don&#8217;t have to break your combo to go pick stuff up, and you can plan your use of powerful moves based on what items appear.  Not only that, but if you <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> pick up an item that you don&#8217;t need, you get money for it instead.<br/></div><br/><div style="text-align: justify;">There&#8217;s a lot of other surprising little touches that show the game&#8217;s fairness.  When you use a weapon on enemies, it&#8217;ll break after a certain number of hits, but you can use it to break open all the boxes you like.  Punching exploding barrels doesn&#8217;t blow them up, and there are unlimited continues with frequent checkpoints.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">GOD HAND</span> is not difficult because the game environment is arranged to be stingy, irritating, or punishing.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">GOD HAND</span> is difficult because you don&#8217;t know how to play it yet.<br/></div><br/><div style="text-align: justify;">To get good at the game, you&#8217;ll have very little tutorial to rely on.  Practicing with every move, studying enemy behavior, mastering the subtly versatile dodging system, and managing your tension meter are all genuine skills you develop as you make your way through <span style="font-weight: bold;">GOD HAND</span>.  You can actually learn a lot by watching other people, as I did with <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2784203">this thread</a>.<br/></div><br/><div style="text-align: justify;">Besides the fact that the gameplay is <span style="font-style: italic;">super rewarding</span>, though, why should you play <span style="font-weight: bold;">GOD HAND</span>?  Because it&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">hilarious</span>.  Anyone who&#8217;s played a <span style="font-style: italic;">Resident Evil </span>game knows Shinji Mikami&#8217;s knack for B-movie kitsch, but the celebrated campiness in this game has been turned all the way up.  Dialogue between the protagonists is awkward and nonsensical, charmingly childish, and never tries to be genuinely moving.  All the characters have literally the <span style="font-style: italic;">most awesome names possible</span>, and the animations and subtle gags are better than I can possibly describe.  Every single note is hit perfectly.<br/></div><br/><div style="text-align: justify;">In the end, the experience of playing <span style="font-weight: bold;">GOD HAND</span> is put best in the words of a scantily-clad woman you rescue from a pair of dominatrices: </div><blockquote>I can&#8217;t believe this is happening!  They smacked my ass so many times&#8230; But in the end, I started to like it!</blockquote>
