Four games! Here&#8217;s my take:<br/></div><div align="justify"></div><div align="justify"><br/></div><div align="justify"><em>Bayonetta</em>: Hey, we&#8217;re innovating on the <em>Devil May Cry</em> formula! Finally! I love all three <em>Devil May Cry</em> games, a lot, but hopefully this will finally make my dream of <em>Viewtiful Joe</em>-style time control combined with <em>Devil May Cry</em> action a reality. Interestingly enough, this is <em>exactly</em> the team that could do it and do it right.</div><div align="justify"><br/></div><div align="justify"></div><div align="justify"><br/></div><div align="justify"><em>Infinite Line</em>: I never played Steel Battalion and we really have no info on this other than that it&#8217;s a DS RPG, but there are no pieces of this puzzle so far that do <em>not</em> sex me up.</div><div align="justify"><br/></div><div align="justify"></div><div align="justify"><br/></div><div align="justify"><em>MadWorld</em>: I love Nintendo consoles because I don&#8217;t think videos games need to be violent to be fun, significant, or even awesome. That said, I like violent video games and think Nintendo needs more of them. Maybe one of these days I&#8217;ll gush about <em>No More Heroes</em>, but for now it&#8217;s enough to say that it tickled me in very private, very splendid ways. It was like an easygoing <strong>GOD HAND</strong> on the Wii, with absolutely sociopathic amounts of blood and arbitrary violence. <em>MadWorld</em> looks like it&#8217;s going even further, as instead of making all the blood grey or whatever in Japan they are simply not going to release it there at all. This game will be indulgent, offensive, bloody, and on a Nintendo console. Make it happen.</div><div align="justify"><br/></div><div align="justify"></div><div align="justify">Shinji Mikami: Yeah, he&#8217;s working on a game.  There are rumors that Suda 51 (the guy who made <em>Killer 7</em> and <em>No More Heroes</em>) is involved.  That&#8217;s all we know, but I&#8217;m going to go ahead and pretend they&#8217;re making <strong>GOD FOOT</strong> together.<br/></div>Nothing can spoil this day.
