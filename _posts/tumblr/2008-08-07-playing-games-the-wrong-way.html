<p>"Sometimes you have to make your own fun" is a phrase I heard often as a child. I can&#8217;t claim to have had a especially active imagination, but I did run around in the woods with my friends making stuff up. <br/><br/>When I got older my friends and I would try to best each other&#8217;s accomplishments on NES. Many of the games had built in &#8220;yard sticks&#8221; for player skill, Metroid rewarded speedy play with bonus ending content and Super Mario Brothers 2 had hidden levels for expert players. Recent games are no different, with Xbox Live Achievement Points and PSN Trophies. <br/><br/>I don&#8217;t have any complaints about these modern revisions of classic game extending modes and competitions. I just hope that the artificial creation of extended game play goals doesn&#8217;t end up killing the idea of &#8220;screwing around&#8221; in a game just because.<br/><br/>When a player has extracted all the achievement points he can from a game, do they never return to it? I&#8217;ve started to notice this happening lately to games that should have absurd levels of replay value. I wonder if the current generation of games will have speed run communities build up around them?<br/><br/>What happened to the player &#8220;making their own fun?&#8221; What do you think?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SJqWh562jlI/AAAAAAAAAKM/l0GdzQGp6yo/s1600-h/gta.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/SJqWh562jlI/AAAAAAAAAKM/l0GdzQGp6yo/s400/gta.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5231659426371767890"/></a><br/><br/>This was all just an excuse for me to post this comic.</p>
