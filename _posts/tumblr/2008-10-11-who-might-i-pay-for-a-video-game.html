<p>Half year ago I was bugged to write something about folks out there that I would like to give money to.  You know for making games or something.<br/><br/>I figure there are plenty of game makers out there that are creative, and I am pretty sure my contemporaries here at supple think have named plenty of them.<br/><br/>I will take a different tack.  Here are three “fine” artists that I think make some pretty neat stuff.  I would really just like to see what these folk would do with a medium such as electronic entertainment.  With a video game how do you integrate meaning without subjecting your audience to a movie?  Will their creativity and training cross over?  Google any of these names to find their websites and look at more of their work.<br/><br/>Michael A.

He has his faults, but if you can get by the clichés in his beliefs then you can enjoy his work for what it is.  I really wonder if he could maintain his sensibilities about the world if he was challenged with making a game with market appeal.<br/><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ZCZUetrS7Kc/SPF2Mnu-nvI/AAAAAAAAAAs/lHifs5yvCOA/s1600-h/nobartiste2.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ZCZUetrS7Kc/SPF2Mnu-nvI/AAAAAAAAAAs/lHifs5yvCOA/s320/nobartiste2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5256112199314611954" border="0"/></a><br/><br/>Kris Kuksi<br/>Kuksi’s latest work is incredible, called “the grotesque.”  Imagine navigating an environment styled in such a way, with game play and story driven by such a mind.<br/><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ZCZUetrS7Kc/SPF2aDtzoJI/AAAAAAAAAA0/N4WL3fv3lK0/s1600-h/ds-master+better-lower_0.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ZCZUetrS7Kc/SPF2aDtzoJI/AAAAAAAAAA0/N4WL3fv3lK0/s320/ds-master+better-lower_0.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5256112430164189330" border="0"/></a><br/><br/>That is about it for now.  I have listed three artists; there are however hundreds if not thousands of established “fine” artists that would make excellent additions to development teams.<br/><br/>I have qualified “fine” in this article because art and artist are perhaps two of the most meaningless terms in the English language.<br/><br/>I just hope writing on this blog I can expose at least a few of my friends to some art they will enjoy.</p>
