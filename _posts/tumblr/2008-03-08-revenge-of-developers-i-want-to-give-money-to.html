Since K1’s list included two individuals that I would have included in my top five (Shigesato Itoi &amp; Daisuke Amaya) my list is a shorter. My criteria for selecting these are a little different from K1’s, but this is all about personal taste anyway.<br/><br/><div><div><div><p>What I’m trying to say is, “up yours kid.” </p><p></p><p>#4 - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASA_Corporation">Fasa</a> (<em>Shadowrun</em> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_%28SNES%29">SNES</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_%28Sega%29">Genesis</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_%28Mega_CD%29">SegaCD</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_%282007_video_game%29">Xbox360/PC</a>): <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175495534036473394" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/R9MNxGrdVjI/AAAAAAAAAHs/qeH2ze4Dl0E/s200/shadowrun.jpg" border="0"/></p><p>Before the Xbox 360 launched, one of the titles that was announced but not shown was <em>Shadowrun</em>. I am absolutely in love with the previous three games for three separate reasons. The promise of a new <em>Shadowrun</em> was quite exciting, the after the three previous games had all taken very different approaches to creating their games and I believed that Microsoft Game Studios would do this as well. Their different approach was to throw away all the interesting story elements of the <em>Shadowrun</em> universe and create a FPS. A FPS with magical trees, teleportation and gameplay that was absolutely forgettable. I’d like to give a developer money for a new<em> Shadowrun</em> RPG, but after the horrible sales of the FPS, I think developers believe the <em>Shadowrun</em> License has AIDS.<br/></p><p>#3 – <a href="http://www.vivarium.co.jp/index.html">Vivarium</a> (<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaman_%28video_game%29">Seaman</a></em>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odama"><em>Odama</em></a>): <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/R9MOg2rdVkI/AAAAAAAAAH0/VFfGtkd1yu4/s1600-h/seaman2.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175496354375226946" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/R9MOg2rdVkI/AAAAAAAAAH0/VFfGtkd1yu4/s200/seaman2.jpg" border="0"/></a></p><p>“Yoot” Saito was both the key designer and &#8220;face&#8221; of Seaman, most people who owned a Dreamcast or at least have a passing interest in games recognize his face and maybe even attempted to have a “conversation” with him. His unforgettable Dreamcast title <em>Seaman</em> is one of the creepiest and most interesting video game I’ve ever witnessed. He also was the creative force behind the innovative Gamecube pinball title, <em>Odama</em>. Both games share the innovative idea of changing the way players interact with games; forcing the player to speak into a microphone to control the game just as often as they use a controller. I’d love to play more games by Yoot Saito that have innovative strange controls like this, but <em>Seaman 2</em> was not released in the US and the DS’s microphone is almost never used for the sort of detailed open ended interactions that players can experience in a Yoot Saito game. </p><p>#2 - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Behemoth">The Behemoth </a>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_hominid"><em>Alien Hominid</em></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_crashers"><em>Castle Crashers</em></a>):<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/R9MPZ2rdVmI/AAAAAAAAAIE/1lQQZne-1cE/s1600-h/CastleC.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175497333627770466" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/R9MPZ2rdVmI/AAAAAAAAAIE/1lQQZne-1cE/s200/CastleC.jpg" border="0"/></a></p><p><em>Alien Hominid</em> was an excellent first title that started out as a flash game and made the jump to consoles, the game play is very similar to SNK’s <em>Metal Slug</em> series and is not only fun to play but quite difficult. Their second title is the 4 player action platformer / RPG <em>Castle Crashers</em> has been endlessly delayed. I’m practically salivating at the idea of playing a “new” guardian heroes style game with my friends. I’d be willing to pay way more than 800 Rape Bucks (a.k.a. Microsoft points) for this title. Too bad it seems to be stuck in development hell.</p><div>#1 – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_%28company%29">Cave</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DonPachi"><em>DoDonPachi</em></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushihime-sama"><em>Mushihime-sama</em></a>): <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/R9MQBmrdVnI/AAAAAAAAAIM/vl-GweRPThM/s1600-h/ddonpach.png"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175498016527570546" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ImV5yFk87rs/R9MQBmrdVnI/AAAAAAAAAIM/vl-GweRPThM/s200/ddonpach.png" border="0"/></a></div><div></div><div></div><div>Cave has been providing 2 new SHUMPs a year for several years. Their games are simultaneously frustrating and beautiful, the intricate bullet patterns and artwork of the game impress players as much as they distract them to their doom. I’d love to give Cave my money, but I don’t want to spend $500~$1200 USD on a JAMMA board or import a PS2 port that can be generously described as less than arcade perfect.</div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>
