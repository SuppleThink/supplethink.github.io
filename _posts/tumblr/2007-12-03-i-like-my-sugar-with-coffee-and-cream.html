Also, now that I&#8217;ve got all 120 I feel like I&#8217;m more qualified to detail the game&#8217;s triumphs and its colossal, abject failures.<br/></div><div> </div><br/><div style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m joking about the failures.  Some kids are going to complain that it has colors and big noses and shit, but honestly the only problems I can pick out about this game are very personal quibbles, and everything else about it makes me want to shout its praises to the world from my window.  I get sort of used to thinking of Miyamoto as a kind of gaming artisan, a genius of concept, design, and execution.  Miyamoto makes a bunch of <em>Citizen </em><em>Kane</em>s or whatever. The idea is by this point so oversaid and underrepresented that it feels totally bogus.  After enough of this you start to forget something important: <strong>Shigeru Miyamoto is a fucking visionary</strong>.</div><br/><div> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Every single aspect of <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> is absolutely <em>refulgent</em> with polish, insight, care, and grace.  The learning curve is so natural you can&#8217;t even tell that it&#8217;s happening, and every challenge the game presents feels difficult without punishing the player.  This balance has not been seen since <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Island</em>, where the game challenges you to explore its depth rather than its continue system.  The most difficult stars to get in the entire game, the ones I look back on with any kind of frustration, took me about five to ten tries to nail down, and I got them the same day I started trying.  This isn&#8217;t bragging&#8212;it&#8217;s a learning curve that applies to each level, each ability, each challenge you&#8217;re presented with.  It&#8217;s absolutely stunning.<br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div> </div><br/><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iYhX8dUeagI/R1P0yg0k2mI/AAAAAAAAAGg/Qa_mWLy-xvo/s1600-R/wiiplay.jpeg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iYhX8dUeagI/R1P0yg0k2mI/AAAAAAAAAGg/OMwSDxCl3lQ/s320/wiiplay.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5139720748400958050" border="0"/></a>The controls are almost exactly perfect.  I feel strange saying this, since I never hear anybody else say it ever, but I love <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> with a sort of passion.  The &#8220;secret&#8221; levels were an aggravating mess, but the water pack and smooth jump controls made everything else a joy.  My initial feeling when I started playing <em>Galaxy</em> was that it was pretending <em>Sunshine</em> never happened, but if you look closely it&#8217;s all in there.  Sure, the camera controls may have taken a step back to the N64 days (an unfortunately common problem among Wii games), but the hover nozzle is still there in spirit with the massive air control you get with a spin jump, and the rest of the controls aren&#8217;t back to the stiff garbage that plagued <em>Mario 64</em> (yeah, I said it).  Simply put, it&#8217;s almost as much fun to just hop around and see what you can climb as it was in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sunshine</span>, and with the added bonus that making (and pulling off) enormously long leaps of faith is a total blast.<br/></div><br/><div style="text-align: justify;">A lot of <span style="font-style: italic;">Galaxy</span>'s success is that it is exquisitely paced.  There's nowhere near as much exploration as there was in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sunshine</span>, but the game has plenty of it for those of us who want it.  There are speed challenges, no-hit challenges, puzzles, platforming, races, and bosses, all in perfect quantities.  Even the gimmicky Wiimote levels are a blast, with the most polished control I&#8217;ve seen of its kind and tough but reasonable expectations of the player.  The levels are even completely optional, tucked away beyond the realm of casual play.<br/></div><br/><div style="text-align: justify;">All of this contributes to a sense of momentum, the feeling that the game can&#8217;t wait for you to see what&#8217;s next.  Most importantly, even after getting all 120 stars I sometimes fire it up just to play around and see what I can skip past, jump on, or fly to.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Super Mario Galaxy</span> may be one of the best examples yet of a &#8220;sandbox&#8221; game: there are many solutions to problems, the levels are fun to explore and push to their limits, and you can play it as deep or as shallow as you like.<br/></div><br/><div style="text-align: justify;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_iYhX8dUeagI/R1PzMQ0k2lI/AAAAAAAAAGY/WNpIH5B97TY/s1600-R/marioperspective.jpeg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_iYhX8dUeagI/R1PzMQ0k2lI/AAAAAAAAAGY/GTpsJsc9NzQ/s320/marioperspective.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5139718991759333970" border="0"/></a>Most important of all, though, is how <span style="font-style: italic;">Galaxy</span> evolves beyond all previous 3D platformers.  A habit of mine while playing a brand new game is to think about the reactions it would get from someone who had only ever seen an NES.  If you took <span style="font-style: italic;">Mario 64</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Sunshine</span> back in time twenty years you&#8217;d get lots of oohs and ahhs, a few moments of confusion at playing a game in 3D, and then pure satisfaction.  If you think about it, these are the exact reactions we all had when <span style="font-style: italic;">Mario 64</span> first came out.  If you were to take <span style="font-style: italic;">Galaxy</span> back with you, though, people would be simply unprepared for it. The game builds on the last ten years of 3D gaming, Z-jumping forward into brand new territory from the outset.  It constitutes the next great leap forward in the platforming genre, and while it&#8217;s not as eye-popping as the move to 3D was it&#8217;s still every bit as significant.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic;">Super Mario Galaxy</span> may just be one of the most important games ever made.  Play it, or else you may not be prepared for what&#8217;s coming next.<br/></div></div>
