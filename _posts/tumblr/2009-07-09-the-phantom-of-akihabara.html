Here&#8217;s a taste:<br/><br/>&#8221;<em>Gamers never attach themselves to creators; they follow series names, the brand of the games they play. That was one of the ironclad rules of the industry. In fact, once a company establishes a brand and makes a “promise” to their user base, it’s more secure for them to keep following that promise, releasing conservatively-designed, me-too sequels and freshening up the “promise” with whatever the latest in graphic technology allowed. It is that kind of world.</em>&#8221;<br/><br/><a href="http://magweasel.com/2009/05/08/phantom_of_akihabara_1/">Chapter I</a><br/><a href="http://magweasel.com/2009/05/13/phantom-of-akihabara-2/">Chapter II</a><br/><a href="http://magweasel.com/2009/06/13/phantom-of-akihabara-3/">Chapter III</a><br/><a href="http://magweasel.com/2009/07/06/phantom-of-akihabara-4/">Chapter IV</a></p>
